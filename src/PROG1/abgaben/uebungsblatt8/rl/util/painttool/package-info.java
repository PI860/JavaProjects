/**
 * This package provides all classes of the Paint Tool. The
 * Paint Tool is a small configurable application framework which
 * supports data presentation and animations using simple 2d graphics.
 * The classes {@link rl.util.painttool.PaintTool} is the central element
 * of the framework. Its main method shows a frame with a canvas and a toolbar
 * with two demo buttons added. Class {@link rl.util.painttool.PaintDemoApp}
 * demonstrates how to extend the functionality by providing
 * a modified version of the controller class
 * ({@link rl.util.painttool.PaintDemoController})
 * to the constructor of {@link rl.util.painttool.PaintTool}.
 * 
 * <p>When adding the classes to your Java project, make sure
 * that the corresponding package directories have been created
 * before.</p>
